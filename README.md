# Graphical-Binary-Tree
Binary tree is a representation of data in form of root and their child nodes. Each child node contain some data and has the option of having left or right child node. So this project basically focuses on representation of Binary Tree using graphics..

One can further help me to enhance this, as currently it can handle those Binary which have height 2 or 3 or 4 . As after this Nodes may intersect visually. Though it will build the tree of any height(depending on the screen-size) but understandibilty decreases as child-nodes overlap with each other.
